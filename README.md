# password_saver
A secure, user-friendly browser extension for encrypted password storage, auto-fill, and cross-device sync with robust privacy features.
**Description for Password-Saving Browser Extension Project**  

Develop a **Password-Saving Browser Extension** that securely stores and retrieves user credentials for various websites. This extension streamlines the login process while prioritizing user privacy and data protection. Key features include:  

1. **Secure Storage**: Use advanced encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) to securely store passwords locally or in a cloud service, ensuring that unauthorized parties cannot access sensitive information.  
2. **Auto-fill Functionality**: Automatically fill in saved login credentials on recognized websites, reducing the need for manual input.  
3. **Cross-Platform Sync**: Enable synchronization of credentials across devices using secure cloud storage (optional).  
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to manage their saved passwords, generate strong passwords, and edit or delete entries.  
5. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Integrate optional 2FA for an added layer of security during critical operations, such as accessing the vault or exporting data.  
6. **Secure Master Password**: Protect access to all stored credentials with a single, robust master password.  
7. **Browser Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge through an extension interface.  
8. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR or CCPA, making data handling transparent and secure.  

The project will involve working with web technologies such as **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, alongside APIs provided by browsers like **WebExtensions API**. Emphasis will also be placed on secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS or data breaches.  

This extension caters to users who seek a simple yet secure solution for managing their online credentials, balancing convenience with robust protection.
